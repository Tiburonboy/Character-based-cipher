    "## Abstract\n",
    "This paper documents an educational coding project that implements a cipher based on a two round Feistel structure and operates on characters instead of bits.  The character set is the English alphabet consisting of 26 letters, A to Z; all other characters and spaces are removed before processing.      \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of the paper is to document a coding project that implements a character based encryption scheme.  This is an educational project for exploring aspects of the Feistel structure.  The code developed here is not intended to implement a secure encryption scheme, only to explore and document some interesting aspects of encryption.  The code will take as plain text input, blocks of text consisting of characters A to Z, and output ciphertext blocks, also consisting of characters A to Z.  The code will strip any non-alpha characters from the input text before encipherment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption is the process of encoding information so that converts the original of the information, known as plaintext into into an alternative form known as ciphertext.  The ciphertext is what is transmitted to prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages <span id=\"a1\">[[1]](#f1)</span>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In December 2020, the Zodiac cipher, Z340, was solved after more than 51 years and a very interesting YouTube video on the solution was published <span id=\"a2\">[[2]](#f2)</span>.  The solution to solving the cypher was a combination of brute force and hill climbing.  The cypher was meant to be eventually decoded, otherwise why would the Zodiac send it?  But the cypher turned out to be very difficult and the solution involved lots of computer time employing random trials.  As bits of the message were uncovered, these were used as clues to help solve the remaining message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Zodiac’s first cypher was solved on August 8, 1969, by Donald and Betty Harden of Salinas, California. David Oranchak has a very interesting video on the history and solution of this cipher <span id=\"a3\">[[3]](#f3)</span>. The first cipher, given the name, Z408, since there were 408 characters in the message.  The cipher was divided into three parts and each part wassent to a different news paper.  Each part of the cipher had 17 columns and 8 rows of symbols for a total of 408 symbols.  54 different symboles were used in the message.  The key for the solved cipher had some letters encoded by different symbols, which is called subsitution with suppression of frequencies.  Since individual letter frequencies were supressed, Donald and Betty focused on double symbols in the cipher and they look for a four letter pattern that would fit the word KILL.  Eventyually they solved the Z340 cipher and sent their solution into the news paper, who passed the solution onto the police.\n",

    "Figure 1: The solution key to the Z408 cipher. (think about redrawing the key)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second cypher, Z340, was 340 symbols long with 63 different symbols.  Both the Z408 and the Z340 ciphers were extinsivally studied with the thought that some clues from the Z408 solution could be used to solve the Z340 cipher.  Eventually, by trial and error, it was suspected that the symbols in the Z340 cipher might be interleaved somehow. David Oranchak's video on the Z340 describes the solution to the cipher.     \n",

    "The Zodiac wanted the Z340 to be harder to decode, but did he suspect that it would remain unread for so long?  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other well know examples of ciphers that operate on characters.  The Playfair[] and the German Enigma[] are examples of character based cyphers.  These ciphers were used prior to the modern computer era.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Playfair cipher is encrypts pairs of letters and is harder to break than simple substitution ciphers.  This is because frequency analysis does not work with this cipher.  Breaking the cipher by hand required a lot of work, however, by using modern computers and using a shotgun hill climbing method, the cipher can be broken quickely [].  \n",

    "The German Enigma is a cipher that uses a typewriter based machine to encode and decode the messages [].  Each press of the keyboard causes the machine state to advance and implement a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.  Polish, British and eventually Americam criptogeraphers spent concerderable effort during World War II to break the German Enigma.   \n",

    "Watching David Oranchak's video on the solution of the Z340 got me interested in looking at cyphers.  In this programming project, we are not going to invent a new cipher.  We are going to use the well known Feistel network and use some ideas from the Data Encryption Standard [] [] that operates on characters as opposed to binary data.  \n",

    "The goal of this programming project is to design a character based cipher that is non-trival to break. A character based cypher based on two rounds of a Feistel network could be such a cipher.  It would not be secure by present day standards, therefore could present a strong puzzle to someone who likes such challenges. However, I think a single encrypted message would be almost impossible to break, if both the key and algorthium were secret.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Feistel network is a data flow map which can be used to construct a block cipher[].  The cipher structer is named after the German-born physicist and cryptographer Horst Feistel who did pioneering research while working for IBM and several well known ciphers use the Feistel network.  In most implementations binary data is processed as bits, but in this project, characters will be processed as the unit8 type data.  The figure below shows the Feistel network.\n",

    "The input data is divided into blocks, which are divided into half blocks, Left and Right.  The Right half block is passed through the function F(), called the Feistel function, and then XOR'ed with the Left half block.  As shown Figure, there is an additional application of the XOR and F().  The Left and Right out puts when combined is the encrypted data block.  The Feistel network is invertible, even if the round function is not itself invertible.\n",

    "### 2.b) Character encoding for processing <a id=\"section2b\"></a> \n",
    "In computers, letters and other symbols are encoded for electronic communication.  Historically, one of the first methods for encoding letters and numbers was Morse code.  Morse code was and still is used for sending messages over radio waves, but not as much on telegraph wires.  This type of encoding was used for the efficient transfer of information and not for encryption of the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The test message is encoded as ASCII characters within the computer file <span id=\"a9\">[[9]](#f9)</span>.  The capital letter A is the decimal number 65, B is 66 and so on, all the way to Z, which is 90.  Thus the capital leters of the aplhabet are encoded as the numbers 65 to 90.  For processing, the code below subtracts 65 from the decimal representation to encode the characters as numbers that range from 0 to 25, thus A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25.        \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to convert the text message from ASCII values to an array of numbers, where A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25.  The following line of python do that.  Additionally, the numbers in the array are of data type unit8, which means that all the numbers in the array are 8 bit unsigned intergers.  This is important to note since some of the mathmatic operations on the data will be automatically performed as unsigned 8 bit intergers.\n",

According to Wikipedia[], the purpose of the S-box is to hide the relationship between the key and the ciphertext.

    "The Mixer is a matrix of 0 or 1 values and is used to expand operation of s-boxes across several characters in the message half-block.  Without the Mixer matrix, the S-box output character would be only depended on its corresponding input character and therefore there would exist a one to one correspondeance.  The one to one correspondance would make it easier to walk backwards throuh the encryption steps and recover the key from know cipher text and the known correspong plain text.  The ability to recover the key in this way is considered a weakness and discussed more in the cryptanalyssis section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of Mixer combines at least two other characters in the half-block with the main character using modulo 26 addition.  The mixed character is then used as the index to the S-box and the out put is corresponding value in the matrix.  Changing one character in the half-block causes multiple characters in the S-box output to change.  This cascade feature is a desirable feature for S-boxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Mixer matrix is not a part of the DES Fiestal function.  However, within the DES S-Box, 6 bits are used as inputs to each DES S-Box and the outer bits together with the four inner bits are as corrdinates into a look up table for the corresponding 4 bits of output.  The effect is that a group of bits is used to determine the output group of bits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this same idea, of a many to one relationship, the mixer matrix is implement as an identity matrix with a few other ones sprinked around the matrix, more or less at random.  When the matrix is multipled by the input vector, each value in the output will depend on the corresponding input as well as at least two other elements in the input vector.  In this way the out character is a mix of several input characters.    \n",

A simple pass through function or a one way hash function could be used.  Since we are not going to design a new function from scratch, we will just follow the DES Feistel function with some modifications.  Primarily, the use of the Mixer matrix is new and the S-box and the P-table are different.\n",

    "Expansion: the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits using the expansion permutation, denoted E in the diagram, by duplicating half of the bits. The output consists of eight 6-bit (8 × 6 = 48 bits) pieces, each containing a copy of 4 corresponding input bits, plus a copy of the immediately adjacent bit from each of the input pieces to either side.\n",
    "Key mixing: the result is combined with a subkey using an XOR operation. Sixteen 48-bit subkeys—one for each round—are derived from the main key using the key schedule (described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitution: after mixing in the subkey, the block is divided into eight 6-bit pieces before processing by the S-boxes, or substitution boxes. Each of the eight S-boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non-linear transformation, provided in the form of a lookup table. The S-boxes provide the core of the security of DES—without them, the cipher would be linear, and trivially breakable.\n",

    "Permutation: finally, the 32 outputs from the S-boxes are rearranged according to a fixed permutation, the P-box. This is designed so that, after permutation, the bits from the output of each S-box in this round are spread across four different S-boxes in the next round.\n",
    "\n",

    "The alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called \"confusion and diffusion\" respectively, a concept identified by Claude Shannon in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher."

This is repeated a fixed number of times, and the final output is the encrypted data. An important advantage of Feistel networks compared to other cipher designs such as substitution–permutation networks is the entire operation is guaranteed to be invertible (that is, encrypted data can be decrypted), even if the round function is not itself invertible. The round function can be made arbitrarily complicated, since it does not need to be designed to be invertible.[2]:465 [3]:347 Furthermore, the encryption and decryption operations are very similar, even identical in some cases, requiring only a reversal of the key schedule. Therefore, the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved.\n",

    "Electronic codebook (ECB)  \n",
    "The simplest of the encryption modes is the electronic codebook (ECB) mode (named after conventional physical codebooks[19]). The message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately.\n",
    "The disadvantage of this method is a lack of diffusion. Because ECB encrypts identical plaintext blocks into identical ciphertext blocks, it does not hide data patterns well. ECB is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols.[20][21][22]\n",
    "\n",
    "Cipher block chaining (CBC)  \n",
    "Ehrsam, Meyer, Smith and Tuchman invented the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of operation in 1976.[23] In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This way, each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point. To make each message unique, an initialization vector must be used in the first block.\n",
    "CBC has been the most commonly used mode of operation. Its main drawbacks are that encryption is sequential (i.e., it cannot be parallelized), and that the message must be padded to a multiple of the cipher block size. One way to handle this last issue is through the method known as ciphertext stealing. Note that a one-bit change in a plaintext or initialization vector (IV) affects all following ciphertext blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other modes, don't discuss    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Propagating cipher block chaining (PCBC)   \n",
    "The propagating cipher block chaining[25] or plaintext cipher-block chaining[26] mode was designed to cause small changes in the ciphertext to propagate indefinitely when decrypting, as well as when encrypting. In PCBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with both the previous plaintext block and the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. As with CBC mode, an initialization vector is used in the first block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full-block CFB   \n",
    "The cipher feedback (CFB) mode, in its simplest form is using the entire output of the block cipher. In this variation, it is very similar to CBC, makes a block cipher into a self-synchronizing stream cipher. CFB decryption in this variation is almost identical to CBC encryption performed in reverse:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output feedback (OFB)   \n",
    "The output feedback (OFB) mode makes a block cipher into a synchronous stream cipher. It generates keystream blocks, which are then XORed with the plaintext blocks to get the ciphertext. Just as with other stream ciphers, flipping a bit in the ciphertext produces a flipped bit in the plaintext at the same location. This property allows many error-correcting codes to function normally even when applied before encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "other options are block chaining   \n",
    "\n",
    "When encrypting data using a block cipher in cipher block chaining (or another) mode, it is common to introduce an initialization vector to the first stage of the encryption process. It is typically required that this vector be chosen randomly (a nonce) and that it is not repeated for any given secret key under which the block cipher operates. This provides semantic security, by means of ensuring the same plain text is not encrypted to the same cipher text, allowing an attacker to infer a relationship exists.\n",

    "Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed such system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed \"computationally secure\"; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated, and if necessary, adapted. There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power =— an example is the one-time pad —- but these schemes are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs, Claude Shannon proved that the one-time pad cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly random, never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message.[50] Most ciphers, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack, but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., \"work factor\", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a ciphertext-only attack, Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a known-plaintext attack, Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a chosen-plaintext attack, Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is gardening, used by the British during WWII. In a chosen-ciphertext attack, Eve may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts.[4] Finally in a man-in-the-middle attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient.[51] Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the protocols involved).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts (with their corresponding ciphertexts) and approximately 243 DES operations.[52] This is a considerable improvement over brute force attacks.\n",

    "What Is Linear Cryptanalysis?   \n",
    "Linear cryptanalysis is a known plaintext attack, in which the attacker studies probabilistic linear relations known as linear approximations between parity bits of the plaintext, the Ciphertext and the secrete key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this technique, the attacker obtains high probability approximations for the parity bit of the secrete key by analyzing the parity bits of the known plaintexts and ciphertexts. By use of several techniques such as the auxiliary technique, the attacker can extend the attack to find more bits of the secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear cryptanalysis together with differential cryptanalysis are the most widely used attacks on block ciphers. The linear cryptanalysis technique was first discovered by Mitsuru Matsui who first applied it to the FEAL cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are usually two parts to linear cryptanalysis; the first is to construct linear equations relating to plaintext, Ciphertext and key bits that have a high bias; that is whose probabilities of holding are as close as possible to 0 0r 1. The second part is to use these linear equations in conjunction with known plaintext-ciphertext pairs to drive key bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Differential Cryptanalysis?  \n",
    "Differential cryptanalysis can be described as a general form of cryptanalysis that is primarily applicable to block ciphers, cryptographic hash functions. In other words, it entails a careful analysis of how differences in information input can affect the resulting difference at the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In block cipher, differential analysis can be described as a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits what is known as non-random behavior and exploiting such details to recover the secrete key (cryptography key).\n",
    "\n",
    "For any particular cipher, the input difference must be keenly selected for the attack to be successful. An analysis of the algorithm’s internals is undertaken; the standard method is to trace a path of highly probable differences through the various stages of encryption, referred to as differential characteristic. In the process, observing the desired output difference between the two chosen or unknown plaintext inputs suggests possible key values.\n",
